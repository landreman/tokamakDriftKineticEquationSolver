This program requires PETSc. For information about installing PETSc, see 
http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/
This code was developed and tested using PETSc version 3.3-p2, and may or may 
not be compatible with other versions.

To compile, you must have the environment variables PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH set.
This can be done using e.g.
export PETSC_DIR=/home/johndoe/petsc-3.3-p2
export PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux2-c-debug
making whichever substitutions are appropriate for your system.  These commands
could be included in your .bashrc file for convenience.

For improved speed, it is recommended that you turn off debugging and add 
optimization flags when building PETSc.  This can be done by adding the flags
--with-debugging=0 --COPTFLAGS=-O3 --FOPTFLAGS=-O3
when running PETSc's configure utility.  It is also recommended that you build
PETSc with shared rather than static libraries, since the resulting executable
file is then much smaller.  This is done by adding the flag
--with-shared-libraries
when running PETSc's configure utility.

To build the drift-kinetic solver, type
make all

Options are set by editing the file input.namelist.

To run the code, type
./tokamakDriftKineticEquationSolver

To clean up old files, use
make cleaner
rather than
make clean
since the former also cleans up subdirectories and output files, whereas the latter
is set by PETSc to only clean up .o and .mod files in the main directory.

To plot results of a convergence scan, you may use the Matlab script
plotFortranConvergenceScanOfTokamakDKESolver.m
